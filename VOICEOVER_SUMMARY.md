## 📁 File Organization

After creating audio files, organize like this:

```
Cvproject-1/
├── audio/                    ← Create this folder
│   ├── page1-intro.mp3
│   ├── page2-sensors.mp3
│   ├── page3-techniques.mp3
│   ├── page4-context.mp3
│   ├── page5-review.mp3
│   ├── page6-future.mp3
│   └── page7-bibliography.mp3
├── index.html
├── sensors.html
├── techniques.html
├── context.html
├── review.html
├── future.html
├── bibliography.html
└── VOICEOVER_SCRIPTS.md     ← Your scripts
```

## 🔧 Integration (After Creating Audio)

### Step 1: Create audio folder
```bash
mkdir audio
# Move your MP3 files into this folder
```

### Step 2: Update HTML files

In each HTML file, find this:
```html
<div class="audio-placeholder">
    <p><strong>🔊 Audio Summary Required:</strong> ...</p>
</div>
```

Replace with:
```html
<div class="audio-container">
    <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/page1-intro.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    <p class="audio-caption">🔊 Audio Summary (2:30)</p>
</div>
```

(Change filename for each page: page1-intro.mp3, page2-sensors.mp3, etc.)
